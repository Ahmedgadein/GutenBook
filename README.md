# GutenBook

### Project Gutenberg
Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, as well as to "encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.

Check out the main project website at: https://www.gutenberg.org/

### The App
This is a simple App powered by the wonderful JSON api https://gutendex.com/ for the Project Gutenberg ebook metadata.

### Implementation
I followed the recommended Android MVVM architecture. I also used the following libraries: <br/>

- Paging Library
- Retrofit
- Hilt Dependency Injection
- Navigation Components
- Room database
- Viewbinding
